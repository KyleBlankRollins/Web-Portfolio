          <p>Hi, I'm Kyle Rollins – nice to meet you!</p>
          <p>
            I'm a technical writer by day and a content/web developer by night.
            I always enjoy solving challenging problems and there's always a new
            challenge in web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            While you're here, take a look at some of my writing samples or web
            development projects.
          </p>

          <h3>Building this site</h3>
          <p>
            It's funny how things circle around. The first iterations of my
            portfolio site were 100% vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Then it
            was VuePress, a static site generator that uses Vue.js. And then it
            was Vue CLI and Tailwind CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            This version? Plain ol' HTML and CSS with a little vanilla
            JavaScript (mostly for accessible navigation). I have a couple of
            subdomains through Netlify that let me play around with more
            complicated things.

          <p>
            Most of my writing is covered under NDAs and not shareable. However,

                    I worked with the support organization's web team to update
                    the look and feel of our support website.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It was much harder than it seems, as we were working with an
                    Oracle knowledgebase tool that doesn't like to expose its
                    inner workings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We were able to get around most of the issues by writing
                    custom JavaScript and overwriting default CSS styles. We
                    also trimmed as much as possible from what the tool shipped
                    by default. All in all, despite the custom logic and styles,
                    the site performs better than it did before the redesign and
                    ships less code.

                    Webhelp Next was a JavaScript single-page application (SPA)
                    that understands custom transformed content from Author-it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 3M HIS Technical Communications team uses Author-it to
                    create and maintain documentation. In 2019, Author-it
                    announced their intent to retire the SPA output the team had
                    been using for product libraries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The proposed alternative didn't satisfy us. So, I set out to
                    build our own SPA that could understand Author-it output on
                    a deep level, yet only include the features customers
                    needed. Enter Webhelp Next.

                    <strong>Tools.</strong> Webhelp Next was built with Vue CLI.
                    The content it consumes is transformed from XML to HTML via
                    a custom XSLT file.

                        quite easy to use. More importantly, it's extremely easy
                        to share within the company. Just copy a report's URL
                        and send it to interested stakeholders.

                        users can take based on that data. Each report processes
                        the Google Analytics data independently to ensure it's
                        reliable and usable.

                        <strong>Gridsome GraphQL layer.</strong> The GraphQL
                        data layer in Gridsome makes all sorts of interesting
                        things possible. For example, creating lists of posts
                        that share a tag or a series. And none of it requires a
                        server - it's all done during the build process.

                        recent posts.

                    The Canney Valley (TCV) is where I publish technical
                    tutorials and share my thoughts on life. Unfortunately, it
                    hasn't gotten the attention it deserves in terms of content.
                    Some day, I'll get to writing more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    TCV is built with Gridsome, which is a static site generator
                    that uses GraphQL and Vue.js.

            While I'm fairly happy with the state of this site, there are a few
            more things I'd like to add. At the very least, I'll add a "Document
            design" and "Contact" section.

            While he was eating, did you hear anyone laughing? Like... in the
            kitchen area? Yes! Yes I did, actually, yes I did. That'd be trouser
            food! No, no there you go, no there you go. I just heard it come on.
            Oh really? Then why don't you come down and make me then. 0115...
            no... 0118... no... 0118 999 ... 3. Hello? Is this the emergency
            services? Then which country am I speaking to? Hello? Hello? Hello,
            IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again? Oh my God. I didn't
            even know Smarties made a cereal. They don't. It's just Smarties in
            a bowl with milk.

            Uh... okay, well, the button on the side, is it glowing? So,
            remember the new number! 0118 999! 88199, 9119 725! ... 3!
            Unbelievable! Some idiot disabled his firewall, meaning all the
            computers on Seven are teeming with viruses, plus I've just had to
            walk all the way down the motherfudging stairs, because the lifts
            are broken AGAIN! Nicer ambulances, faster response times and better
            looking drivers mean they're not just the Emergency Services,
            they're your Emergency Services. I'll put this over here, with the
            rest of the fire. I am a man, he's a man, we're men! Ok, tell me how
            your feeling. I feel delicate... and annoyed, and... I think I'm
            ugly.

            Hello? Carrie, Moss! First scene in Carrie! Oh. Okay I am a man,
            he's a man, we're men! Ok, tell me how your feeling. I feel
            delicate... and annoyed, and... I think I'm ugly. Shut up, do what I
            tell you, I'm not interested; these are just some of the things
            you'll be hearing if you answer this ad. I'm an idiot and I dont
            care about anyone but myself. P.S. No dogs! Carrie, Moss! First
            scene in Carrie! Oh. Okay See the driver hooks a function by
            patching the system call table, so its not safe to unload it unless
            another thread's about to jump in there and do its stuff, and you
            don't want to end up in the middle of invalid memory!
